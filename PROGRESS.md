## Log

### 2026-06-20

- **T05 — `artha build`** done. Compiles `.artha/` YAML → SQLite + FTS5 index
  (schema §8). Pipeline: load/validate (T02) → resolve pins (T04, unresolvable =
  build failure naming the ref) → recompute hashes, fill blanks, flip drifted
  certified entries to `stale` on disk → expand scope globs → warn on dangling
  refs → emit. Fully offline. 7 tests + verified end-to-end.
  - **Zero new dependencies:** uses Node 26's built-in `node:sqlite` (FTS5
    compiled in) and `fs.globSync`. `node:sqlite` is loaded via `createRequire`
    so vitest/Vite (whose builtin list predates it) doesn't choke.
  - `buildIndex(repoRoot, config)` → `Promise<BuildReport>` (async, since the
    resolver is). `.artha/index.db` is the read contract for T08/T09.

- **T03 — Config loading & `artha init`** done. `loadConfig(repoRoot)` returns a
  typed `ArthaConfig` layered over defaults (pure + sync; missing file → defaults,
  malformed → ArthaError, mistyped fields → per-field fallback). `artha init`
  idempotently scaffolds `.artha/{decisions,invariants,conventions}/` (+`.gitkeep`)
  and a commented `config.yaml`, never clobbering an existing config or entries.
  12 tests. Default miner model kept at `claude-opus-4-8` (no silent downgrade; Q1
  semantics still owned by T06).

- **T04 — SymbolResolver** done. Built-in tree-sitter JS/TS resolver behind the
  `SymbolResolver` interface; resolves `path#Symbol` and `path#Class.method`,
  hashes normalized spans for staleness. 15 tests.
  - **Open Q4 resolved:** normalize whitespace, keep comments (a comment-only
    edit flips staleness). Isolated to `normalizeForHash` in `src/resolver/hash.ts`.
  - Deviation: `web-tree-sitter` pinned to `0.20.8` (≥0.25 changed the WASM
    linking model and won't load `tree-sitter-wasms` grammars).
  - Deviation: `createTreeSitterResolver` is async (`Promise<SymbolResolver>`)
    because WASM init is async; `resolve`/`hash` remain sync. **T05 must await.**

- **T02 — Schema, types & validation** done. The `.artha/` data model in code:
  `ArthaEntry` union, §9 JSON Schema, AJV validator, YAML loader/dumper. 14 tests.

- **T01 — Project scaffold & tooling** done (commit `638c968`). npm package,
  `artha` CLI shell with stub subcommands, MCP entry, test/lint/typecheck wired.

## Open questions still pending (do not silently resolve)

- **Q1** miner model default vs. cost → owned by T06
- **Q2** idempotency ledger location → owned by T06
- **Q3** PR vs. commit mining → owned by T06
- **Q5** success-test baseline definition → owned by T10
- ~~**Q4** content-hash normalization~~ → resolved 2026-06-20 (see T04 log)
